# edgebird
...is a minimalistic WordPress theme built on the CSS framework Siimple. It is used as a theme in my personal WordPress 
[blog](http://www.chrisonntag.com/blog) and is meant to really focus on the content â€“ not on excessive design elements. 
This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GNU General Public License. Use it for whatever you want to make something great.

# What it can do
This theme is ready to be translated into every language you want. Translations can be filed in the
[/languages/](/languages/) directory. 
If you're building a theme based on __edgebird__, use a _find and replace_ to change __edgebird__ to the name of your theme 
in all the template files.

It supports WordPress' *Featured Images* and the following *Post Formats*:
* Aside
* Audio
* Video
* Chat
* Quote

Furthermore __edgegbird__ features a very cool way of zooming into images. "It zooms in really smoothly, and then 
when you're done, scrolls away, [esc] keys away, clicks away ..". 
Thanks to [fat's zoom.js](https://github.com/fat/zoom.js/tree/master).

The anatomy of a typical post looks like:

    Featured Image
      |
      V
    Title
      |
      V
    Author Information
      |

Besides [Siimple](https://siimple.github.io/) as a CSS framework and grid system, __edgebird__ also uses the 
[FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) icons in some parts. 

# What it can't do
Right now it's not possible to create pages with __edgebird__, it's a pure blogging theme.

Have fun.
